Code written during Summer 2022. Project goals were to decrease computation time for a Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation analysis, then use data from a LOOCV analysis on a large dataset to determine optimal thresholds for an trademark violationd detection algorithm. 

Efficient LOOCV was written to run in conjunction with functions written by collaborators at DePaul University but heavily modified by myself. The script utilizes performance-oriented data compression and multithreading to decrease computation time on availible hardware from an estimated 3,000 hours to 24 hours.

Find Thresholds utilizes data from a LOOCV analysis on a large dataset in conjunction with user-provided pairs of trademark infringing logos to determine ML thresholds which minimize false positive identifications while flagging 100% of infringing comparisons for review.
